// The mixed examples intentionally combine 51Degrees Device Detection and
// IP Intelligence. They live in their own module so that the root
// ip-intelligence-go module does not depend on device-detection-go.
// This module is never published; the replace directive resolves the
// IP Intelligence dependency to the enclosing repository.
